# Privacy Policy – Coffee Rings
**Effective date:** October 2025

## Controller
Responsible for data processing within this app is:

Michael Knop  
Email: coffeerings.app@gmail.com

---

## Data processed
The app “Coffee Rings” does not process any personal data that directly identifies you. The only data stored are:
- Espresso recipes & shot parameters entered by the user
- Optional notes or ratings related to your shots

This data can be stored locally on your device. Optionally, users may:
- Back up or restore recipes and settings via iCloud (CloudKit). In that case, data is stored on Apple’s servers in accordance with Apple’s privacy policies.
- Export recipes and save them anywhere (e.g., locally, in another cloud service, or on external drives).

---

## Use of AI features (OpenAI)
- The app optionally allows you to enter your own OpenAI API key to receive AI-based recommendations.
- In that case, data is transmitted directly between your device and OpenAI’s servers.
- The developer (Michael K. Knop) has no access to your API key, the transmitted input, or the AI output.
- OpenAI may process or store data in accordance with its own policies. The scope of processing depends on the settings and agreements you, as the user, have with OpenAI (see OpenAI Policies).

---

## No disclosure to third parties
The developer does not share any data with third parties. Any processing outside of the app (e.g., via OpenAI or iCloud) occurs only if the user explicitly enables those features.

---

## Your rights
Under the GDPR, you have the right to:
- Access your stored data
- Rectify inaccurate data
- Erase your data
- Restrict processing
- Data portability

Since the app works locally, you can delete your data at any time yourself (e.g., by removing recipes, resetting settings, or uninstalling the app).

---

## In-App Purchases (Tip Jar)
All payments are processed solely by Apple Inc. through your App Store account. The developer does not receive any personal data related to these purchases (such as name, address, or payment information). Apple acts as the data controller for these transactions under its own privacy policies. You can view your purchase history in your App Store account.

---

## Changes to this policy
This privacy policy may be updated if necessary. The current version will always be available within the app and on the App Store page.
