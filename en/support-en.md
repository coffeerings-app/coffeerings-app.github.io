## ❓ FAQ

**How does the offline recommendation work?**  
→ Coffee Rings uses an integrated knowledge base built on barista logic and extraction science – no network connection needed.

**What’s the purpose of the optional AI analysis?**  
→ It offers additional context and learning insights. All data is sent directly between your device and OpenAI; the developer never sees it.

**Where is my data stored?**  
→ By default, locally on your device. Optional iCloud sync is fully private and tied only to your Apple account.

**How can I report a bug or give feedback?**  
→ Email **dev@mkknop.de** with a short description and screenshot if possible. We usually reply within a few days.
